# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! üöÄ  
This project showcases an end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution. Right from building the data warehouse to delivering actionable insights ‚Äì it's all covered. This is my portfolio project, demonstrating practical skills in handling data to drive informed decisions.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture
This project uses a Medallion Architecture to organize its data in three stages:

**1.Bronze Layer:** Raw data, just as it comes in from sources (like CSV files into a SQL Server Database).

**2.Silver Layer:** Cleaned, standardized, and normalized data, making it ready for basic analysis.

**3.Gold Layer:** Business-ready data, structured in a star schema for easy reporting and advanced analytics. 

This layered approach helps ensure data quality and makes it easier to use the data for analysis.

## üìñ Project Overview

**Data Architecture:** Using Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers).

**ETL Pipelines:** Setting up processes to extract, transform, and load data seamlessly into the warehouse.

**Data Modeling:** Designing fact and dimension tables, optimized for super fast analytical queries.

**Analytics & Reporting:** Building SQL-based reports and dashboards to get actionable insights for the business.

Basically, we're building a robust data system to ensure high-quality data and efficient analytics for better decision-making!

## üöÄ Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
